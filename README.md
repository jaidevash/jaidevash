# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jaidevash, or **Jaidev Ashok**
I graduated out of IIT Kanpur in 2020 with a major in Aerospace Engineering, and a minor in Computer Systems. I spend my days working as a financial consultant, using tech to drive key deliveries for clients. 

Iâ€™m interested in analytical work where impact is unequivocally visible. 

Iâ€™m currently learning **Python**, **C++**, **R**, **SQL**, and **VBA**. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real-world problems that are optimization-based or that involve data-driven solutions.
