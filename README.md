# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Jaidev Ashok**
I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 2020 with a Bachelors in Technology, majoring in Aerospace Engineering and minoring in Computer Systems. I work as a financial consultant and use tech to develop and deliver solutions for clients in the ESG / sustainable finance space. 

Iâ€™m interested in analytical work where impact is unequivocally visible. You can offer a map to pique my interest. 

I use **Python** in my day-to-day, and have used at various times in the past **SQL**, **C++**, and **VBA**. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real-world problems that are optimization-based or that involve data-driven solutions. 

***How to reach me?** Find me at LinkedIn or shoot me an e-mail at **ans.jaidev@gmail.com**, and let's start talking!*
