# 👋 Hi, I’m **Jaidev Ashok**
I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 2020 with a Bachelors in Technology, majoring in Aerospace Engineering and minoring in Computer Systems. I work as a financial consultant and use tech to drive key deliveries for clients in the ESG / sustainable finance. 

I’m interested in analytical work where impact is unequivocally visible. Maps interest me, and I could go on for hours looking at them. 

I use **Python** in my day-to-day, and have used at various times in the past **SQL**, **C++**, and **VBA**. I’m looking to collaborate on real-world problems that are optimization-based or that involve data-driven solutions. 

***How to reach me?** Find me at LinkedIn or shoot me an e-mail at **ans.jaidev@gmail.com**, and let's start talking!*
