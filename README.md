# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Jaidev**
I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 2020 with a Bachelors in Technology, majoring in Aerospace Engineering and minoring in Computer Systems. I work as an analytics consultant and use tech to develop and deliver solutions for clients in the ESG / sustainable finance space. 

You can offer me a **map** to pique my interest. Iâ€™m interested in analytical work where impact is unequivocally visible. 

I use **Python** in my day-to-day, and have used **SQL**, **C++**, and **VBA** various times in the past. 
At work, I have been playing around with climate scenario data, geospatial analysis, quick interactive dashboards, as well as ETL challenges. I have had to refactor a code base from R to Python with no literacy. I feel like at every step of the way, I have evolved. From writing scribbly codes that ran over hours to neatly documented object-oriented code that runs in seconds, I have come a long way, and I thank my mentors, peers, **and** my juniors for it. 
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on solving real-world problems that involve data-driven solutions.
